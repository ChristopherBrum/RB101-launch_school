Asking Questions on the Forum:
  -Lead with error message or describe the problem.
  -Outline steps taken so far to solve the problem, make sure to have exhausted all avenues for solving it yourself.
  -Paste a link of your code, probably a link to your githu repo. Make sure its to the specific file so its easy to find. 
  -Can use gist.com or pastepin.com to link to code snippets.

Code Reviews:
  -One code review per project.
  -Wait to request code review until you've completed the bonus features so those can be reviewed as well. 
  Don't submit multiple code rerviews at once. By submitting them one at a time you can put the advice/guidance into practice for thge next code review. 
  -Make sure your code is working and as close to complete as possible before submitting it for a code review. 

Active Learning:
  - Make sure there are no external distractions (turn off tv, cell phone)
  - Take notes
  - Look up concepts you don't understand
  - Afterwards, try to articulate the concepts in your own words (this is one reason later in the course we ask you to blog about what you learned)
  - Don't browse Facebook, Twitter, etc while video is running
  - Visualize yourself in a classroom, and even fabricate some competition with fellow students, if that helps you stay motivated
  - The videos are usually capped at 1 hour, so try to maintain active listening for that duration
  - Review your notes after the video to make sure you have captured the key concepts

Good/Bad Questions
  - There are no dumb questions but learning to ask good questions is important.
  - Before asking a question thoroughly test it and do everything you can to solve it yourself.
  - Write the problem out.
  - Experiment with it in irb and pry.

PEDAC:
  -You may not need PEDAC in every problem, but you’ll find a lot of advantages to employing some system when working on more sophisticated problems. The more complex the coding problem, the more you need a rigorous process like PEDAC.
  -PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, Examples / Test Cases, Data Structure, Algorithm, and Code.” PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
  -Processing the problem consists of 4 steps that lead you from the initial problem statement to a solid understanding of what is required. The result is the Algorithm, which you will use to implement the solution.
  -Once you have understood the problem, chosen an appropriate data structure, and have an algorithm to approach the problem, all you need to do is convert the algorithm into the programming language of your choice. We call this final step coding with intent, and the final result is the implementation.
